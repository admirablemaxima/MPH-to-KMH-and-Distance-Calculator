# MPH-to-KMH-and-Distance-Calculator
MPH to KMH with Distance Calculator created with Python

Hello people!
I created my first ever simple program to calculate MPH to KMH and Distance.

I used kmh * 1.609 as formula for MPH to KMH, and for distance (previous speed in KMH that you entered) * hours (that you will input)
